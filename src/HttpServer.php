/**
 * The `React\Http\HttpServer` class is responsible for handling incoming connections and then
 * processing each incoming HTTP request.
 *
 * When a complete HTTP request has been received, it will invoke the given
 * request handler function. This request handler function needs to be passed to
 * the constructor and will be invoked with the respective [request](#server-request)
 * object and expects a [response](#server-response) object in return:
 *
 * ```php
 * $http = new React\Http\HttpServer(function (Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface $request) {
 *     return new React\Http\Message\Response(
 *         React\Http\Message\Response::STATUS_OK,
 *         array(
 *             'Content-Type' => 'text/plain'
 *         ),
 *         "Hello World!\n"
 *     );
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Each incoming HTTP request message is always represented by the
 * [PSR-7 `ServerRequestInterface`](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/#321-psrhttpmessageserverrequestinterface),
 * see also following [request](#server-request) chapter for more details.
 *
 * Each outgoing HTTP response message is always represented by the
 * [PSR-7 `ResponseInterface`](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/#33-psrhttpmessageresponseinterface),
 * see also following [response](#server-response) chapter for more details.
 *
 * This class takes an optional `LoopInterface|null $loop` parameter that can be used to
 * pass the event loop instance to use for this object. You can use a `null` value
 * here in order to use the [default loop](https://github.com/reactphp/event-loop#loop).
 * This value SHOULD NOT be given unless you're sure you want to explicitly use a
 * given event loop instance.
 *
 * In order to start listening for any incoming connections, the `HttpServer` needs
 * to be attached to an instance of
 * [`React\Socket\ServerInterface`](https://github.com/reactphp/socket#serverinterface)
 * through the [`listen()`](#listen) method as described in the following
 * chapter. In its most simple form, you can attach this to a
 * [`React\Socket\SocketServer`](https://github.com/reactphp/socket#socketserver)
 * in order to start a plaintext HTTP server like this:
 *
 * ```php
 * $http = new React\Http\HttpServer($handler);
 *
 * $socket = new React\Socket\SocketServer('0.0.0.0:8080');
 * $http->listen($socket);
 * ```
 *
 * See also the [`listen()`](#listen) method and
 * [hello world server example](../examples/51-server-hello-world.php)
 * for more details.
 *
 * By default, the `HttpServer` buffers and parses the complete incoming HTTP
 * request in memory. It will invoke the given request handler function when the
 * complete request headers and request body has been received. This means the
 * [request](#server-request) object passed to your request handler function will be
 * fully compatible with PSR-7 (http-message). This provides sane defaults for
 * 80% of the use cases and is the recommended way to use this library unless
 * you're sure you know what you're doing.
 *
 * On the other hand, buffering complete HTTP requests in memory until they can
 * be processed by your request handler function means that this class has to
 * employ a number of limits to avoid consuming too much memory. In order to
 * take the more advanced configuration out your hand, it respects setting from
 * your [`php.ini`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php) to apply its
 * default settings. This is a list of PHP settings this class respects with
 * their respective default values:
 *
 * ```
 * memory_limit 128M
 * post_max_size 8M // capped at 64K
 *
 * enable_post_data_reading 1
 * max_input_nesting_level 64
 * max_input_vars 1000
 *
 * file_uploads 1
 * upload_max_filesize 2M
 * max_file_uploads 20
 * ```
 *
 * In particular, the `post_max_size` setting limits how much memory a single
 * HTTP request is allowed to consume while buffering its request body. This
 * needs to be limited because the server can process a large number of requests
 * concurrently, so the server may potentially consume a large amount of memory
 * otherwise. To support higher concurrency by default, this value is capped
 * at `64K`. If you assign a higher value, it will only allow `64K` by default.
 * If a request exceeds this limit, its request body will be ignored and it will
 * be processed like a request with no request body at all. See below for
 * explicit configuration to override this setting.
 *
 * By default, this class will try to avoid consuming more than half of your
 * `memory_limit` for buffering multiple concurrent HTTP requests. As such, with
 * the above default settings of `128M` max, it will try to consume no more than
 * `64M` for buffering multiple concurrent HTTP requests. As a consequence, it
 * will limit the concurrency to `1024` HTTP requests with the above defaults.
 *
 * It is imperative that you assign reasonable values to your PHP ini settings.
 * It is usually recommended to not support buffering incoming HTTP requests
 * with a large HTTP request body (e.g. large file uploads). If you want to
 * increase this buffer size, you will have to also increase the total memory
 * limit to allow for more concurrent requests (set `memory_limit 512M` or more)
 * or explicitly limit concurrency.
 *
 * In order to override the above buffering defaults, you can configure the
 * `HttpServer` explicitly. You can use the
 * [`LimitConcurrentRequestsMiddleware`](#limitconcurrentrequestsmiddleware) and
 * [`RequestBodyBufferMiddleware`](#requestbodybuffermiddleware) (see below)
 * to explicitly configure the total number of requests that can be handled at
 * once like this:
 *
 * ```php
 * $http = new React\Http\HttpServer(
 *     new React\Http\Middleware\StreamingRequestMiddleware(),
 *     new React\Http\Middleware\LimitConcurrentRequestsMiddleware(100), // 100 concurrent buffering handlers
 *     new React\Http\Middleware\RequestBodyBufferMiddleware(2 * 1024 * 1024), // 2 MiB per request
 *     new React\Http\Middleware\RequestBodyParserMiddleware(),
 *     $handler
 * ));
 * ```
 *
 * In this example, we allow processing up to 100 concurrent requests at once
 * and each request can buffer up to `2M`. This means you may have to keep a
 * maximum of `200M` of memory for incoming request body buffers. Accordingly,
 * you need to adjust the `memory_limit` ini setting to allow for these buffers
 * plus your actual application logic memory requirements (think `512M` or more).
 *
 * > Internally, this class automatically assigns these middleware handlers
 *   automatically when no [`StreamingRequestMiddleware`](#streamingrequestmiddleware)
 *   is given. Accordingly, you can use this example to override all default
 *   settings to implement custom limits.
 *
 * As an alternative to buffering the complete request body in memory, you can
 * also use a streaming approach where only small chunks of data have to be kept
 * in memory:
 *
 * ```php
 * $http = new React\Http\HttpServer(
 *     new React\Http\Middleware\StreamingRequestMiddleware(),
 *     $handler
 * );
 * ```
 *
 * In this case, it will invoke the request handler function once the HTTP
 * request headers have been received, i.e. before receiving the potentially
 * much larger HTTP request body. This means the [request](#server-request) passed to
 * your request handler function may not be fully compatible with PSR-7. This is
 * specifically designed to help with more advanced use cases where you want to
 * have full control over consuming the incoming HTTP request body and
 * concurrency settings. See also [streaming incoming request](#streaming-incoming-request)
 * below for more details.
 *
 * > Changelog v1.5.0: This class has been renamed to `HttpServer` from the
 *   previous `Server` class in order to avoid any ambiguities.
 *   The previous name has been deprecated and should not be used anymore.

     * server.
